Writable and executable sections
--------------------------------

This query identifies ELF files which contain sections which are both
writable and executable:

    SELECT symboldb.nevra(package), file.name, type
      FROM symboldb.elf_program_header
      JOIN symboldb.file USING (contents_id)
      JOIN symboldb.package USING (package_id)
      JOIN symboldb.package_set_member USING (package_id)
    WHERE writable AND executable
      AND set_id = symboldb.package_set('Fedora/rawhide/x86_64')
    ORDER BY 1, 2, 3;

If an object file lacks a GNU_STACK section, the stack is implicitly
marked as writable and executable.  A GNU_STACK section might also
explicitly request a writable and executable stack.

    SELECT symboldb.nevra(package), f.name
      FROM symboldb.file f
      JOIN symboldb.elf_file USING (contents_id)
      JOIN symboldb.package USING (package_id)
      JOIN symboldb.package_set_member USING (package_id)
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM symboldb.elf_program_header eph
                      WHERE eph.contents_id = f.contents_id
                      AND type = 1685382481 AND NOT (writable AND executable))
      AND set_id = symboldb.package_set('Fedora/rawhide/x86_64')
    ORDER BY 1, 2;
