Comparing files in a package set against a SUID whitelist
---------------------------------------------------------

The input file needs the following format:

<permissions><TAB><user name><TAB><group name><TAB><file path><NL>

The permissions are in the rwx format and need to include the initial
"-" (for "regular file"), e.g.:

-rwsr-xr-x	root	root	/usr/bin/su

The SQL for performing the comparison follows.  You need to replace
the COPY statement with something that loads the `whitelist` table.

    CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE whitelist
      (permissions TEXT NOT NULL, user_name TEXT NOT NULL,
       group_name TEXT NOT NULL, path TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY);
    -- Load the table:
    -- COPY whitelist FROM STDIN;
    CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE suid_files AS SELECT
        symboldb.nevra(package), file.name AS path,
        fa.user_name, fa.group_name,
        symboldb.file_mode_full(fa.mode) AS permissions
      FROM symboldb.package JOIN symboldb.file USING (package_id)
      JOIN symboldb.file_attribute fa USING (attribute_id)
      JOIN symboldb.package_set_member USING (package_id)
      WHERE set_id = symboldb.package_set('Fedora/rawhide/x86_64')
        AND (fa.mode & 3072) <> 0;
    SELECT nevra COLLATE "C", path COLLATE "C",
        suid_files.user_name AS actual_user,
        suid_files.group_name AS actual_group,
        suid_files.permissions AS actual_perms,
        whitelist.user_name AS expected_user,
        whitelist.group_name AS expected_group,
        whitelist.permissions AS expected_perms
        FROM whitelist JOIN suid_files USING (path)
      WHERE
        (whitelist.user_name, whitelist.group_name, whitelist.permissions)
        IS DISTINCT FROM
        (suid_files.user_name, suid_files.group_name, suid_files.permissions)
    UNION ALL SELECT nevra, path, user_name, group_name, permissions,
        '<unexpected>', '<unexpected>', '<unexpected>'
      FROM suid_files WHERE path NOT IN (SELECT path FROM whitelist)
    UNION ALL SELECT '<missing>', path, '<missing>', '<missing>', '<missing>',
        user_name, group_name, permissions
      FROM whitelist WHERE path NOT IN (SELECT path FROM suid_files)
    ORDER BY 1, 2;

This shows only differences between the whitelist and the actual file
system view.  `<unexpected>` entries are missing from the whitelist
(but there is a package installing these files).  `<missing>` entries
are present in the whitelist, but there is no RPM package which
contains them.
